# API Automated Tests for new Features
This was a pilot project to implement automated tests for our API using Postman.
The importance of this project for me: It was my first experience with API automated tests and my first approach with Backend development cycle and technologies. 
For QA and Dev team we got another test coverage for our endpoints, got better visibility and updates about our API documentation and improved knowledge, which gave value to prevent future backend bugs.
